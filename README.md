## Hi there 👋

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** passionate about using intelligent systems to automate human tasks and make life more efficient in every aspect.

My interests lie at the intersection of **computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and high-performance, scalable systems**. I’m also fascinated by **simulation and computer graphics**, and I often build small physics simulation projects to learn, explore, and share what I discover.

I’m driven by curiosity — exploring how machines perceive, learn, and make decisions — and by the desire to turn that understanding into real-world impact.

I learn best through building, experimenting, and sharing — that’s why I created this space: to document what I discover and exchange ideas with others who are just as curious about intelligent systems.
